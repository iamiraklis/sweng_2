# Sweng project for Group 2
## 2019/20

### Project Management
- For this project, we could use the ZenHub extension. Which is availible [here](https://www.zenhub.com/extension).
- ZenHub is a team collaboration solution built directly into GitHub. We can plan roadmaps, use taskboards and generate automated reports directly from our work in GitHub.
- We can use the Google Drive for documentation and other relevant file exchanges. I have the folder created [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ErpSNoZmibHD-GwHiezIWRxBtZAbVMLH?usp=sharing).
